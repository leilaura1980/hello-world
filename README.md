# hello-world


Greetings all! 

Leilani here! I'm just messing around and playing with this to learn about the different tasks and features so future projects will hopefully suck less!
I've programmed lighting consoles for live entertainment for over a decade but that was just telling lights what to do and when so I figure why not take some of that knowledge and re-apply it to telling websites and other things what to do.
